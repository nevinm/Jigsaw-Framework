Project Name	:	TestHarness-MasterCommon
Description		:	This project is a TestHarness developed to test the files loading speed for the entire project. 

It loads all the resources from the resources directory.  The resources directory has 4 sub folders. All these are used to categorize the resource files. Directories are listed below.
> resource
	- core-files (put all core files in this folder)
	- theme-files (put all theme files in this folder)
	- data-files (put all data files in this folder)
	- module-files (put all module files in this folder)
A JSON array will be generated from these resource files and sent to client side. HTML5Loader.js has bbeen used for loading these files using the JSON array.

Basically it does the following.
1.	Loading Page
2.	Ideally this load page should test our ability to pre load javascript files, css files, images, html pages, sounds and datafiles (JSON or XML) from a defined list. 
3.	The resource list at the top should only list the resources required to graphically represent and perform the loading page functionality
4.	Output to the Browser Console.
